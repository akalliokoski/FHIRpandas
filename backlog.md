    * use python generators (yield)
* bundle(s) to
    * csv
    * excel
* python naming
* python best practices
* linting
* documentation
* module creation (pip)

* FHIR specifications support
    * should support all the values in codes
        * currently only first code is used e.g. from encounter code and reason code
    * add also code system along with code values
        * currently SNOMED-CT code system expected

* applications
    * notebooks / posts (kaggle kernels, medium)
        * deep learning in healthcare: FHIR, FHIRpandas and fastai
        * exploring FHIR with FHIRpandas
            * FHIR-resources.ipynp
        * share in FHIR, fastai, kaggle communities
    * FHIR to csv & excel service
        * python serverless functions on AWS or GCP
        * front-end
            * upload FHIR JSONs
            - seacrh from public FHIR server  
            * bundle visualization (github-like commit activity)
